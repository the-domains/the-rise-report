description: "While marijuana is not officially legal in Israel, its Ministry of Health offers special licenses that allow 13,000 registered users to access medical cannabis. So far, the only pharmacy licensed to distribute medical marijuana is at Eilat's Yoseftal Medical Center. But the Ministry of Health is hoping to allow distribution of medical marijuana through pharmacies across Israel sometime in 2013."
