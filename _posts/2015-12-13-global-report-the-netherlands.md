The Netherlands has long been at the forefront of offering medical marijuana to its citizens. Medical marijuana was legalized in the Netherlands for use in pharmacies in 2003 and since 2007 several pharmacies have specialized in medical cannabis. They buy medical cannabis in bulk and can therefore deliver the products for a lower price. Three types of medical cannabis are available through pharmacies: Bedrocan, Bedrobinol and Bediol.
